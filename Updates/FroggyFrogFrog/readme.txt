Hi there! The name’s Jellybug! I’m your personal desktop friend, here to keep ya company whether you're using your computer for fun, school, or work. My job is to help ya take a break from your screen, and to keep you productive and on track when you’re working. I’ve got 3 different modes to best help ya out based on what your doing:

Screentime reminder 
This is based on the 20-20-20 rule; every 20 minutes ya look up from your screen and look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. It's meant to give your eyes a break from the screen, to give them time to rest and reset. So every 20 minutes I’ll chime in to remind ya to look up from your screen for 20 seconds, and I’ll play a sound when you’re good to look back. And to add onto that a bit, every hour I’ll remind ya to take a 5 minute break to stretch your body and get some water, so you can keep your body in tip top shape!

Pomodoro technique
You’ve probably already heard of this one! The pomodoro technique already is a super popular time management method. You pick a task and focus on it for 25 minutes, followed by a 5 minute break. By breaking up your work into smaller chunks with breaks in between, it helps make it easier to tackle without feeling overwhelmed or exhausted! I’ll walk ya through 4 rounds of pomodoro - with plenty of positive reinforcement along the way - so you can get your work done no sweat! 

Work session
If you are looking to do a longer work session, the 50-10 rule might be what you need! You know the drill by now; ya do deep focused work for 50 minutes, followed by a 10 minute break. Choose from a 1-5 hour long work session and I’ll handle the rest! I’ll even remind ya to look up from your screen at the 25 minute mark for 20 seconds, so you can still give your body a quick break without getting distracted and disturbing the flow! 

Whatever ya need me to do, I’ve gotcha covered! And if ya don’t need me to do anything at the moment, I’ll just sit in the corner of your screen til you’re ready.
